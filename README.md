## Project 1: A "data story" on the songs of our times
## Sen Dai sd3227
For me, the goal of this project is to solve my three questions by applying tools from natural language processing and text mining:
1.What's the popular genres of music in different decades? 
2.What's the difference of lyrics in different genres of music? 
3.What's the habit of the artist to write the lyrics?Are they Shakespeare or Dumas?
